# Send a Smile UK!
Building an application which allows users to send an image and some words to either a key worker or lonely elderly person in the U.K. due to Covid-19.

I created this app by myself, please take a look at the code and/ or download the app. I am open to any suggestions, improvements etc. I believe I have named classes/ data structures/ functions and variables in a self-explantory way for easy comprehenesion. You can e-mail me at dan96.austin@gmail.com

After I made the application function in an efficient way, I read the book Clean Code and instantaneously saw how my code could be improved. I now see that code doesn't just need to work, it also needs to be read. This simple rule changed the way I structured the app and since then I have re-factored the application in a major way to show my my recognition of this simple but supremely important rule.

Some points:
   - When I made this app I was just beginning to put my new found knowledge into practice. After I created Easy Split I returned to this application to find I had made many             rookie errors. However I have now cleaned the code to a standard I believe to be very good.  
   - I see now how Unit tests can be of huge benefit to the develepment lifecyle, especially TDD. I plan to implement Unit tests when I have the time after I have landed a job as       most of my time now will be commited to searching for the correct company for me and creating a cover letter etc fot he application.
